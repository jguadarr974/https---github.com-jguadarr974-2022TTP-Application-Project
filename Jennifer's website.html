        Hello! My name is Jennifer Gudarrama. I am a sophmore in John Jay. 
        I major in Computer Science. Some of my favorite hobbies are 
        fashion designing,sewing, playing the paino, baking, photoshopping, 
        video/photo editing, and video gaming. All of my backgrounds that 
        you see here are edited by me using the app called PicsArt. I have a
        cat name Luna. She is three years old and she loves running and most 
        of the time she sleeps. She is very loving and loves to cuddle whenever
        she feels like it. When I'm on my bed with my laptop, it's a sign for her 
        that she wants to cuddle.
